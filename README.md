🧩 Python Sudoku Solver with Pygame
This project is a visual Sudoku Solver built using Python and Pygame. It combines the power of recursive backtracking algorithms with an interactive GUI to provide an educational and engaging way to understand how Sudoku puzzles can be solved programmatically.

🚀 Features
🧠 Backtracking Solver – Visualizes each recursive step of solving the Sudoku.

🎮 Pygame GUI – User-friendly interface for interacting with the puzzle.

✍️ Manual Input – Place numbers using keyboard inputs.

👁 Visual Solving – Watch the puzzle solve itself in real-time.

🧪 Validations – Ensures proper placement rules are followed.

💡 Future Enhancements

Add difficulty levels

OCR support to import puzzles via image

Timer and leaderboard

Enhanced UI with themes and colors

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python – High-level language used for logic and structure.

Pygame – Handles GUI rendering and real-time updates.

Sys & Time – Used for game control and delay in visual updates.

📦 Structure
Grid – Full board logic and interface

Cube – Represents individual cells

solve() – Recursive backtracking algorithm

is_valid() – Validity checker for moves

draw() – GUI rendering

main() – Runs the game loop
